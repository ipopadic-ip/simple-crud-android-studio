# Simple CRUD Application in Android Studio (Java)

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Android Studio with Java. The app allows you to manage a list of users where you can:

1. Add Users
2. View All Users
3. Update Users
4. Delete Users

The app does not use any database. Instead, it stores the data temporarily in memory (using a List), and all changes are reset to default values when the app is closed.

# Features
1. Add User
Users can input a name and click a button to add it to the list.
2. View Users
The list of all users is displayed dynamically in a RecyclerView.
3. Update User
Users can select an existing entry, edit it, and update the list.
4. Delete User
Users can delete an entry from the list.
